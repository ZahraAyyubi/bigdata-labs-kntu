## üìö Contents

### üîπ `mongodb-practice/`
Practice on importing and querying document-based data in **MongoDB** using JavaScript and Node.js.  
Tasks included:
- Importing data from Excel (converted to JSON)
- Aggregation pipelines (`match`, `group`, `sort`, `project`)
- Filtering nested documents and array fields
- Indexing for query optimization
- Backup and restore using `mongodump` / `mongorestore`

### üîπ `mapreduce-hadoop/`

- In-mapper aggregation
- Secondary sort and custom partitioning
- Working with distributed datasets (e.g., pizza orders, sports registrations)

### üîπ `pagerank/`
Simulation of **PageRank algorithm** using iterative MapReduce jobs.  
Included:
- Graph input preprocessing
- Iterative updates of rank values
- Termination condition handling
